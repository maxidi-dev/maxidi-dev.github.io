      <description>Automatic prediction of defect types is a crucial aspect in ensuring the quality of production outputs. With the increasing demand for superior quality and complexity, maintaining efficiency and practicality has become paramount. Although deep neural networks are commonly utilized for fault diagnosis, they necessitate a significant amount of data. By employing few-shot learning methods, classification tasks can be performed with a limited number of image samples. However, utilizing a small number of classes (few-classes) in few-shot learning may lead to subpar model performance.</description>

      <description>A fundamental requirement of the manufacturing process is the detection of product defects, and deep learning-based models for quality control are already extensively used in this domain. While there is a drawback to this method which is requires a large dataset to function well, there is also an alternative that uses deep learning to identify defect types from a small sample of datasets, using a few-shot learning approach. In this paper we attempt to use the NEU dataset for few-shot learning, however due of the restricted diversity in the classes, the outcomes might not be ideal if we just use the dataset.</description>
